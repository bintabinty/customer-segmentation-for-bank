# 🏦 Customer Segmentation for Bank Marketing Campaign

## 📋 Project Overview
This project aims to segment bank customers based on their demographic and behavioral patterns to identify potential clients who are more likely to subscribe to term deposit products.  
By applying clustering techniques, we uncover meaningful customer groups that can help in **personalized marketing and better campaign targeting**.
